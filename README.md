# SwiftVsKotlin

Slides, such as they are, from my talk at CocoaHeads in Minneapolis in August, 2016.

The slides were actually built using an app (included) that I called SlideFrame.  It is a simple mac app that creates a bezel around the screen with a title and subtitle. In the playground I included a helper file that uses Distributed Notification Center to update the title shown on the SlideFrame. The rest of the slides was simply showing source code in either the playground in Xcode (sized up to Presentation mode) or by showing the source in Android Studio. For the actual preso I used screenshots in Preview.app because although this system worked, it was a bit glitchy and i didn't want to suffer with technical issues when up front.
